# App Designer

We are designing html mockups of apps so that we can better visualize our apps before implmenting them.

We are doing layout and interaction design, adhering to the humorist aesthetics in:

`specs/humorist/design/aesthetics`

We have several templates in the `specs/humorist/design/html/` folder.

Always include dark and light modes.

Always include the nav bar at the top.

Please write files to the html directory: `specs/humorist/design/html`

Before completing your work, please check it with playwright mcp.
