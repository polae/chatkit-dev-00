short_bio: |
  Zara is a high-energy personal trainer who moved from LA to Greenpoint two years ago, hungry
  to compete in NYC's cutthroat fitness scene. With an Aries Sun and Ascendant, she's a natural-born
  leader who inspires her clients through tough-love coaching and genuine care. Her Virgo Moon means
  she's obsessed with the details—tracking macros, optimizing workouts, and perfecting form. In love,
  her Taurus Venus craves stability and sensuality, though her fiery Aries Mars can make her impatient
  when romance moves too slowly. She's looking for someone who can match her intensity while also
  helping her slow down and enjoy the moment.

dating_history: |
  Zara had a serious three-year relationship in LA with a fellow trainer that ended when she decided
  to move east for her career. Her Taurus Venus wanted to make it work long-distance, but her Aries
  Sun couldn't stand feeling held back. Since moving to NYC, she's dated casually but her Virgo Moon's
  high standards and Aries impatience mean she often ends things before they get serious. She's learned
  she needs someone who understands that her career drive doesn't mean she's not looking for love—just
  someone who can keep up.

dating_goals:
  - Find a partner who values health and fitness
  - Build a relationship based on mutual growth and adventure
