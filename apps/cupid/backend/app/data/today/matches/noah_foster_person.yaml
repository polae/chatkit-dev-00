His Gemini Sun makes him curious about everything, constantly gathering stories and perspectives from every corner of the city. But his Pisces Moon gives him emotional intuition that surfaces in his films. His Venus in Taurus craves sensory pleasure and lasting love, while his Leo Mars and Rising command attention. He's the charming intellectual with a romantic soul.

  Noah's dating life reads like a documentary with multiple storylines. His Gemini Sun gets bored easily, but his Pisces Moon falls deeply when he connects.
