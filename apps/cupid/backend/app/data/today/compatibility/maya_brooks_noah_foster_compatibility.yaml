narrative:
  first_impression: |
    There's quiet recognition rather than fireworks. Her Cancer Rising is gentle; his Leo Rising is warm. The Mars sextile to his Ascendant means she finds his presence comfortable, even attractive. He sees her as nurturing and safe. It's a slow start, but promising.

  emotional_bond: |
    Her Sun sextile his Pisces Moon creates genuine emotional understanding. She grounds his watery emotions; he helps her access deeper feelings. His sensitivity might overwhelm her practical Taurus nature at times, but mostly they flow together.

  romantic_chemistry: |
    Venus sextile Venus is gentle but real. Her Cancer Venus wants emotional intimacy; his Taurus Venus craves sensual comfort. Both value quality time and physical presence. Not flashy chemistry, but deeply satisfying when they relax into it.

  passion_dynamic: |
    Mars trine Sun is excellent for mutual support. Her Libra Mars admires his Gemini Sun's wit; his Leo Mars is drawn to her grounded sensuality. The Mars-Mars sextile means they energize rather than exhaust each other. Compatible rhythms.

  long_term_potential: |
    Solid foundation for a lasting relationship. Lower intensity means less drama but also less volatility. They'd need to consciously create excitement, but the mutual respect and easy flow make daily life harmonious. A relationship that deepens over time.
