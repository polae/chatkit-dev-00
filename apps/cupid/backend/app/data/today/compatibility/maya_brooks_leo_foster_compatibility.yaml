narrative:
  first_impression: |
    Sparks fly immediately - but not the comfortable kind. Her Cancer Ascendant squares his Aries Sun, creating an almost combative tension. She seems too sensitive for his boldness; he seems too brash for her warmth. It takes multiple meetings before they see past the friction.

  emotional_bond: |
    The Moon-Sun conjunction is their saving grace. When her Aries Moon meets his Aries Sun, there's instant recognition - they understand each other's fire and independence. But her Moon opposing his Ascendant means the emotional connection doesn't translate to easy daily interaction.

  romantic_chemistry: |
    Venus trine Venus provides genuine romantic compatibility. She craves nurturing connection; his Aquarius Venus offers intellectual romance. Different styles, but they intrigue each other. The Mars trines add passion when they get past their defenses.

  passion_dynamic: |
    This is the challenge zone. Her Libra Mars wants harmony; his Aquarius Mars wants freedom and experimentation. She pulls toward togetherness; he pushes toward independence. The square to his Moon means her drive can feel overwhelming to his emotional needs.

  long_term_potential: |
    High effort, potentially high reward. They're fundamentally different but not incompatible. Success requires both to appreciate what the other offers - her grounding stability for his fire, his adventure for her routine. Not for the faint of heart.
