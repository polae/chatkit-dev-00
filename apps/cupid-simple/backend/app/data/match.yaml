short_bio: |
  Sam is a charismatic podcast host who moved from Austin to Queens eighteen months ago to break into
  the bigger NYC media market. Their show has grown significantly since the move, but their personal life
  has taken a backseat. Their Gemini Sun makes them naturally curious, adaptable, and able to talk to
  anyone about anything. Their Aquarius Moon adds a progressive, independent streak—they need a partner
  who respects their freedom and shares their values around social justice. With Cancer Rising, they come
  across as warm and approachable despite their mental air sign energy. Their Gemini Venus keeps relationships
  light and fun, while their Taurus Mars provides surprising staying power once they commit. Sam is looking
  for someone who can match their wit and give them the space to be themselves.

dating_history: |
  Sam's dating history is marked by a pattern of running when things get too serious. In Austin, they had
  three significant relationships that all ended the same way—their Aquarius Moon's need for freedom clashing
  with their partners' desire for more commitment. Their Cancer Rising makes people think they're ready for
  deep emotional connection, but their Gemini Sun and Venus prefer to keep things playful and non-committal.
  Since moving to NYC, they've gone on countless first and second dates but rarely make it past the third—
  their fear of losing independence kicks in. Their Taurus Mars suggests they could be loyal and devoted once
  they find the right person, but they need someone who understands that space and intimacy aren't mutually
  exclusive.

dating_goals:
  - Find a partner who's both intellectually stimulating and emotionally mature
  - Build a relationship based on friendship, freedom, and shared curiosity
  - Someone who can help them feel safe being vulnerable
