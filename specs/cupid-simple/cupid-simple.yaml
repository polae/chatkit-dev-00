  USe simple-chat interface layout as a base to start from. 
  To replace the suggested choices. "Welcome! How can I help you today?" -> "Cupid v0.1"

  ANd the onley prompt option should be Play with prompt "Play"

  In the workflow, I have put references to files or loaded them from files. We can do that in the actual thing; we'll develop more robust data and we'll swap in state variables, but for now, let's just read from flat files. Use simple-chat as a starting point; we're not making that many adjustments except changing the prompt options and greeting in the front, and then we're adding a widget, and we want to make sure that that widget renders as it does an agent builder. This has been tested. I've also put the instructions in a separate file which I reference in the workflow, and the data in a different file just to keep it more readable and compact for me, and so that in the development, I can edit those files again. We will likely move to a different system for that, but let's just keep them as files now.
