Currently, in:

`apps/cupid/`

We are using a single mortal, match and compatibility in this folder:

`apps/cupid/backend/app/data`

I would like to be able to use different mortals and matches with their compatibilty charts.

For this, please let's look in ~/GITHUB/PLAY/cupid-play/data

WE have a chatkit expreince that begins with the play screen, but i would like to add a a page overlay or a new page (BEFORE we get to the chatkit expreince that allows a user to see todays mortal (a single card) and then select from three MATHCES, (three smaller cards). When the player selects a match, the comoatibily score.

These elements shoudl mirror the profile widgets (two sizes one big for mortal, three smaller cards for the match selection), the compatibily card should mirror the Compatibilty widget we use in cupid.

When the comptibiliy display is loaded, we should also activeat a button ath the bottom that loads the date into state (exactly as we do in out current version -- now we just have one each).

Can you sketch out in html a starte scrren.

Please follow the style
