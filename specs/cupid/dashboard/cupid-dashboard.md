# Cupid Langfuse Observabilty App

I would like you to make an observability platform for Cupid which uses Langfuse for tracing.

`/Users/johnsteven/GITHUB/CHATKIT/chatkit-dev-00/apps/cupid`

WE have created an html mockup with our sepcifcatino for our MVP dashbaord, in: `/Users/johnsteven/GITHUB/CHATKIT/chatkit-dev-00/specs/cupid/dashboard`

Please use React, Typescript (the same as chatkit without chat kit), Tailwind, and shadcn components, as they are very suited for reaabilty and this purpose.

Please research Langfuse, and its API using the frameworks agent: /Users/johnsteven/GITHUB/CHATKIT/chatkit-dev-00/.claude/agents/research/framework-docs-researcher.md

You can find the langfuse keys in: /Users/johnsteven/GITHUB/CHATKIT/chatkit-dev-00/apps/cupid/backend/.env

I think we should just use a frontend/, backend/ as we do in the Cupid app.

We want to make this in: `/Users/johnsteven/GITHUB/CHATKIT/chatkit-dev-00/dashboards/cupid` as a completely isolated app (you could copy and paster and run it. )

I have a couple of premlimnary questions:

Should we have a React Typsecript fronetnd and pyton bakcnd.

What db?

You will find a README that contains helpful informaton about what we built (the HTML design with functionality).

Let's talk about our stack.

Please let's make a plan.
