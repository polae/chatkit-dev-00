# Cupid Lanfuse Observabilty App

I would like you to make an observability platform for Cupid which uses Langfuse for tracing.

Please research Langfuse, and its API using the frameworks agent: /Users/johnsteven/GITHUB/CHATKIT/chatkit-dev-00/.claude/agents/research/framework-docs-researcher.md

You can find the langfuse keys in: /Users/johnsteven/GITHUB/CHATKIT/chatkit-dev-00/apps/cupid/backend/.env

It would be helpful for you to spin up an agetn to get the data on the server so taht we can talk about what data we shoudl show.

Please also use the best practices researcher agent to research best practices for making langfuse observabilty dashboards.

I'd like to see at least, but please research best design practices for langfuse observatibily t dahsboards in a subagnet before we do.

We have a list of the api endpints (how would we presetn each)

1. The session view: I'd like to see a list of conversations has by user
2. Agent view. so I can see how one agent in the workflow performs across sessions
3. Metrics

Please let's first design each of these screens using ONly html, js, and css. an put your design in: /Users/johnsteven/GITHUB/CHATKIT/chatkit-dev-00/specs/cupid/dashboard/
