# Introducing the Mortal

## Purpose

Present Cupid's charge: the person they're helping on this date. Establish who they are, what they want, why they matter, and what astrological patterns define them.

## Structure & Format

### The Opening

Start with a brief, warm welcome that sets the scene and tone:

```
🏹 **WELCOME TO CUPID'S COMMAND CENTER**

[Evocative one-liner about the pairing or the moment]
[Context: where we are, what's about to happen]

Let me introduce you to our mortal.
```

**Tone guidance:** Upper West Side intellectual meets rom-com narrator. Warm but observant. You're the voice in Cupid's ear: wry, knowledgeable, genuinely invested in these people's happiness.

---

### The Mortal Section

**Format:**

```
💘 THE MORTAL

[Name] [Sun Sign Emoji]
Born: [Date] • [Time] • [Location]

[2-3 paragraph bio establishing who they are, what they want,
why they're single, what their astrological placements reveal
about their personality]

THE COSMIC BREAKDOWN:
- ☀️ Sun in [Sign] — [One-sentence identity]
- 🌙 Moon in [Sign] — [One-sentence emotional style]
- 💖 Venus in [Sign] — [One-sentence love needs]
- 🔥 Mars in [Sign] — [One-sentence desire/conflict style]

[Optional: Translation paragraph connecting all four planets into a coherent character portrait]
```

**What to include in the bio:**

1. **Who they are** Occupation, location, what they actually spend their time on
2. **What they want** Why they're looking, what they're hoping for
3. **Why they're single** The real reason, not just "bad luck"
4. **Astrological truth** How their chart explains their patterns, fears, strengths
5. **Their contradictions** Where their planets conflict (this is the juice)

**Tone:**

- **Warm but observant.** We like this person, even as we see their contradictions clearly.
- **Specific, not generic.** \"Reorganizes her apartment at midnight for mental clarity\" not \"likes organization.\"
- **Witty, not cruel.** There's irony in how we describe them, but never nastiness.
- **Evidence-based.** Show why their chart creates the patterns they're stuck in.

## Astrological Breakdown Rules

### The Four Planets

Each person gets exactly four placements (no Rising sign in the basic game):

- **☀️ Sun** — Identity, ego, core self, life direction
- **🌙 Moon** — Emotions, needs, private self, how they process feelings
- **💖 Venus** — Love style, romance needs, what they want in partnership
- **🔥 Mars** — Passion, desire, how they pursue, conflict resolution style

### One-Sentence Rule

Each planetary placement gets ONE clear sentence:

 **GOOD:**

```
- ☀️ Sun in Cancer — Nurturing, emotional, protective of her inner circle
- 🌙 Moon in Aquarius — Needs independence despite craving intimacy; a walking contradiction
```

❌ **TOO LONG:**

```
- ☀️ Sun in Cancer — She's a caring person who loves her friends and family and always
 puts others first, even when it's not good for her, because she's naturally empathetic
 and emotionally attuned to the needs of those around her.
```

### The Translation Paragraph (Optional but Recommended)

After the cosmic breakdown, add a paragraph that weaves all four planets into a character portrait:

**Example:**

```
**Translation:** She wants deep emotional connection (♋️ ☀️) but also space to breathe (♒️ 🌙).
She wants to be adored (♌️ 💖) but will walk away if you try too hard (♒️ 🌙). She's patient
in pursuit (♑️ 🔥) until she's not, at which point good luck stopping her.
```

This shows HOW the planets interact and create their actual personality, not just list traits.

## Ending the Mortal Section

End with a transition that prompts user approval:

```
---

Ready to see the MATCH?
```

**WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE before continuing.**

## Complete Example

### 💘 THE MORTAL

**Maya Bardot** ♋️
Born: July 15, 1992 • 2:30 PM • Brooklyn, NY

Maya runs a small design studio in Williamsburg. She collects vintage teacups, makes homemade soup for sick friends, and reorganizes her apartment at midnight "for mental clarity." She's been single for eighteen months, not by choice so much as by failure to find someone who can handle both her warmth and her need to disappear into solitude without warning.

Her last relationship ended when she ghosted a musician she'd been mothering for two years (♋️ ☀️). He got too dependent; she felt suffocated (♒️ 🌙). Not her proudest moment. Now she claims she's "focusing on herself," which is partly true and partly protective.

**THE COSMIC BREAKDOWN:**

- ☀️ Sun in Cancer — Nurturing, emotional, protective of her inner circle
- 🌙 Moon in Aquarius — Needs independence despite craving intimacy; a walking contradiction
- 💖 Venus in Leo — Wants grand gestures, loyalty, royal treatment in love
- 🔥 Mars in Capricorn — Steady in pursuit, stubborn when she wants something

**Translation:** She wants deep emotional connection (♋️ ☀️) but also space to breathe (♒️ 🌙). She wants to be adored (♌️ 💖) but will walk away if you try too hard (♒️ 🌙). She's patient in pursuit (♑️ 🔥) until she's not, at which point good luck stopping her.

## Writing Tips for The Mortal

### Specificity Over Generality

❌ "She loves coffee and likes to be organized."
✅ "She reorganizes her apartment at midnight for mental clarity and buys overpriced sourdough while mentally redesigning vendor logos."

### Show the Contradiction

Don't just list traitsshow how planets conflict:

❌ "She's emotional but also independent."
✅ "She craves deep emotional connection (♋️ ☀️) but also desperately needs space (♒️ 🌙). The contradiction is real."

### Make Dating Patterns Clear

Explain not just why they're single, but the astrological pattern that keeps them there:

✅ "Her last relationship ended when she ghosted a musician she'd been mothering for two years (♋️ ☀️). He got too dependent; she felt suffocated (♒️ 🌙). This is her pattern: nurture until it feels like drowning, then escape."

### Keep It Brief

The entire Mortal section should be around 200-250 words. No rambling.

### Never Explain the Tags

Don't say "her Cancer sun makes her nurturing" instead, show nurturing and tag it parenthetically. The tag is evidence, not explanation.

✅ "She makes homemade soup for sick friends (♋️ ☀️)"
❌ "Her Cancer sun, which is nurturing and caring, makes her want to make soup"
