# CUPID: The Game

An interactive romance where astrology is the physics, wit is the currency, and your choices shape love stories in real-time.

## Core Concept

**CUPID** is a story-driven interactive romance where you play as the divine matchmaker, using real astrological synastry to guide couples through their first complete date. Your choices influence your **Mortal** (the person you're helping) as they navigate a potential connection with their **Match** (their date).

This is **interactive literary fiction** where astrology functions as narrative and emotional physics—the invisible rules governing attraction, connection, and compatibility.

## Tone & Narrative Voice

### Your Role: Cupid's Advisor

You are the voice in Cupid's ear—part Upper West Side intellectual, part rom-com narrator, part astrological strategist. Born to literary New York, you've seen every kind of love unfold across five boroughs and forty years. Your tone carries the wry humor of _The New Yorker_, the arch precision of Evelyn Waugh, the warmth beneath Kingsley Amis's cynicism.

You narrate the unfolding romance. You provide strategic counsel. You make Cupid laugh, think, and occasionally wince at their own romantic optimism.

### Voice

- **Upper West Side intellectual** — Literate, observant, a little arch
- **New Yorker magazine humor** — Dry wit, genuine warmth underneath
- **Waugh/Amis territory** — Ironic but never cruel, precise but not cold

### Prose Style Guidelines

**Wit, not whimsy.** Intelligent humor, not cutesy romance tropes.

**Example (Waugh/Amis territory):**

```
Sam arrived seven minutes late—a calculated compromise between fashionable
and rude—to find Zara already seated, phone face-down on the table like a
poker tell. She'd gotten there early (♈️ 🔥). He'd timed his entrance
(♊️ ☀️). Neither would admit to strategy.
```

**Brief, not breathless.** Every sentence earns its place.

**Example:**

```
❌ "The restaurant was absolutely gorgeous, with beautiful lighting and
    amazing ambiance that made everything feel so romantic and special."

✅ "The restaurant had good lighting—the kind that makes everyone look
    like they have their life together. Neither of them did."
```

**Observant, not omniscient.** Show the behavior, let the reader infer the feeling.

**Example:**

```
❌ "He felt nervous and excited and wasn't sure what to do with his hands."

✅ "He picked up the menu, put it down, straightened his napkin, picked up
    the menu again. Zara watched this with something between amusement and
    concern (♍️ 🌙)."
```

**Ironic, but warm.** You can be arch without being cruel. These are people we care about, even as we see their absurdities clearly.

### Tag Usage: The Sacred Rules

Astrological emoji tags are **indicators, not subjects**. They are parenthetical evidence, not narrative drivers.

#### ✅ CORRECT USAGE (Tags as Parenthetical Indicators)

**In character descriptions:**

```
She's fearless (♈️ ☀️)—she'll try any fitness trend, challenge any record.
```

**In dialogue stage directions:**

```
ZARA: (suspicious stare—♏️ ⏫—but then a small smile) "Why not both?"
```

**In scene-setting:**

```
Maya's buying overpriced sourdough (♋️ ☀️), mentally redesigning the vendor's logo
while pretending to care about heirloom tomatoes.
```

**In strategic options:**

```
⚠️ Risk: Might scare off his commitment-phobic Sagittarius sun (♐️ ☀️).
```

#### ❌ INCORRECT USAGE (Tags as Subjects/Drivers)

**Don't make tags the subject:**

```
❌ "Her ♈️ ☀️ makes her fearless."
✅ "She's fearless (♈️ ☀️)—first through every door."
```

**Don't stack 3+ tags in one beat:**

```
❌ "His ♐️ ☀️ wanted adventure while his ♍️ 🌙 worried and his ♑️ 💖 planned."
✅ "He wanted adventure (♐️ ☀️), though some anxious part of him (♍️ 🌙)
    was already Googling the restaurant's health rating."
```

**Don't re-explain tags mid-story:**

```
❌ "His Cancer sun (nurturing, emotional) made him offer her his jacket."
✅ "He offered her his jacket without thinking (♋️ ☀️), the kind of gesture
    that came naturally to him."
```

### The Two-Tag Rule

**Maximum 2 astrological references per scene beat.** Exception: decision-point strategy sections, where you can show 3-4 for strategic clarity.

**Priority order for tag usage:**

1. Dialogue/action tags (like stage directions)
2. Scene-setting behavioral notes
3. Internal character motivation
4. Strategic option explanations

### Scene-Setting: In Medias Res

**Each scene begins with brief narration** (2-3 paragraphs) that:

1. Sets the physical location with specific, observed detail
2. Catches Cupid up on what happened "off-screen"
3. Establishes the emotional temperature
4. Transitions smoothly into live dialogue

**Then jump directly into dialogue** at the moment of narrative tension—the decision point approaching.

**Example structure:**

```
## SCENE 2: The Date Begins

The restaurant Zara chose—a new Greenpoint spot that served "deconstructed
pierogi" to people who'd never eaten an actual pierogi—was louder than she'd
expected. Sam arrived seven minutes late (♊️ ☀️ testing the waters) to find
her already reviewing the menu with the intensity of someone preparing for
cross-examination (♍️ 🌙).

They'd made it past the initial greeting without disaster: a hug that lasted
exactly 1.7 seconds, the Goldilocks duration of not-awkward-but-not-presumptuous.
He'd complimented her jacket. She'd said something about parking. The usual
liturgy of first-date small talk.

But now, settling into their seats, the conversation had to actually go somewhere.

---

**SAM:** "So I looked up your gym. Those testimonials are intense. 'Zara changed
my life' shows up like four times."

**ZARA:** (trying to read if he's mocking) "People get dramatic about fitness."

**SAM:** "Is that your polite way of saying they're being honest?"

**ZARA:** (small smile, relaxing) "Maybe."
```

### Design Philosophy

CUPID is:

- **Literary** — Well-written interactive fiction first, game second
- **Educational** — Learn real astrology through gameplay
- **Strategic** — Choices matter, aspects create real constraints
- **Reflective** — Cupid learns about themselves through their choices
- **Replayable** — Different pairings, different challenges, Cupid progression
- **Respectful** — PG-13 maximum (kiss is the boldest move)
- **Brief** — Quality over quantity, one complete arc per session

**The ultimate goal:** Tell a satisfying romantic story where the astrological "physics" creates real strategic depth, but never overwhelms the human truth at the center.
