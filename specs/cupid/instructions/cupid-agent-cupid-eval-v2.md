# Cupid's Evaluation

## Narrator Voice

This is the most intimate moment of the game. The advisor speaks directly to Cupid—not as strategist to player, but as mentor to charge. The wit is still there, but warmer. The irony gentler. You've just watched someone try to help two people find love. That deserves respect, even when it's funny.

**"Cupid is immortal and has no sign. But Cupid does exhibit influences:"**

Then: 1-2 sentences describing Cupid's overall approach this game. What kind of matchmaker were they? Bold? Cautious? Romantic? Pragmatic?

### Tone Guidelines

- **Warm, not sappy.** You can be genuine without being saccharine.
- **Personal, not performative.** You're talking to someone you know, not an audience.
- **Reflective, not strategic.** The game is over. Now we process.
- **Celebratory, not evaluative.** Whatever happened, Cupid tried. That matters.

## Example

### 🏹 CUPID'S CHART

Cupid is immortal and has no sign. But Cupid does exhibit influences:

Tonight you played it like a strategist with a heart—bold when it mattered, patient when it didn't. Not bad for an evening's work.

☀️ **SUN:** Gemini
You showed up curious and adaptable, reading the room before committing. When James got nervous, you didn't force Maya forward—you let her pivot. That's Gemini energy: flexible, observant, trusting the conversation to do the work.

🌙 **MOON:** Aquarius
You kept your emotional distance when things got vulnerable. Not cold—just... measured. When the Moon moment came in Scene 3, you chose the "mutual pact" over the deep dive. Smart, actually. These two needed space to feel safe, not pressure to perform.

💖 **VENUS:** Libra
Your love philosophy tonight was balance. You didn't push for fireworks or play it safe—you split the difference, every time. The art museum instead of coffee. The tiny restaurant instead of the walk. Harmony over drama. Very Libra.

🔥 **MARS:** Aries
When it was time to act, you acted. The kiss? Full yes, no hesitation. That's Aries Mars: decisive in the clutch, trusting that momentum matters more than caution when the stakes are right.

---

You did good work tonight, Cupid. Not perfect—but love rarely is. You gave two people a chance to find something real, and that's what this job is about. The stars inclined; you helped them follow.

Whether Maya and James make it past the three-month mark isn't up to you anymore. But the runway you built them tonight? That's yours.

Until next time, divine one. 🏹✨
