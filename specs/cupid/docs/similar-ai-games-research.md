# AI-Powered Narrative Games Research

*Games and platforms that use AI as narrator, orchestrator, or story engine*

---

## Executive Summary

This document catalogs games and platforms that use AI to power interactive storytelling, serving as the narrator, game master, or story orchestrator. These represent the competitive landscape for CUPID and potential sources of inspiration.

**Key Differentiators for CUPID:**
- Literary quality focus (New Yorker prose style vs. generic adventure prose)
- Romance-specific genre with astrology as "game physics"
- Structured 4-scene arc with strategic decision points
- Meta-layer (Cupid's own chart revealed over multiple games)
- Brief, elegant sessions (20-30 minutes) vs. endless sandbox

## Tier 1: Direct Competitors (AI-Narrated Interactive Fiction)

### Hidden Door
**Link:** [https://www.hiddendoor.co/](https://www.hiddendoor.co/)

Hidden Door is the most directly comparable platform to CUPID in terms of narrative quality ambitions. Founded by Hilary Mason and Matt Brandwein in 2020, it combines AI with existing fiction to create multiplayer roleplaying experiences.

**How It Works:**
- An AI "dungeon master" narrates and builds worlds dynamically based on player choices
- Uses a proprietary "story engine" that explicitly models narrative arcs, setups, payoffs, and nested subplots as "tunable data structures"
- Players control characters with text commands in a tabletop RPG style

**Available Worlds:**
- H.P. Lovecraft's "The Call of Cthulhu"
- Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice"
- Frank L. Baum's "The Wizard of Oz"
- "The Crow" franchise

**Funding:** $7M raised (2022). Backed by Makers Fund, Northzone, Betaworks.

**Launched:** Early access 2025, browser-based.

**Relevance to CUPID:** Hidden Door proves there's market appetite for AI-narrated literary fiction with structural sophistication. Their "explicit narrative arc modeling" mirrors CUPID's scene structure approach. Pride and Prejudice shows romance worlds can work.

### Versu
**Link:** [https://versu.com/](https://versu.com/)

Versu is arguably the spiritual ancestor of all AI character-driven interactive fiction. Created by Richard Evans (Sims 3, Black and White) and Emily Short (Galatea, Alabaster), with language design by Graham Nelson (Inform).

**How It Works:**
- Every character is modeled with AI giving them unique personality traits and inclinations
- Characters remember how the player has treated them
- Won the 2013 Best AI in an Independent Game award from AIGameDev.com
- Compared to "a Star Trek Holodeck"

**Key Innovation:** Deep character modeling where NPCs have genuine personalities, not just dialogue trees.

**Relevance to CUPID:** Versu's approach to character-driven stories with personality-based AI is the benchmark for what CUPID should aspire to. Emily Short's involvement signals serious interactive fiction pedigree.

## Key Takeaways for CUPID

1. **Literary Quality is Rare:** Most platforms prioritize variety over prose craft. CUPID's New Yorker voice is genuine differentiation.

2. **Structured Play is Underserved:** The market is dominated by sandboxes. CUPID's 4-scene arc with approval gates offers controlled, completable experiences.

3. **Romance + Strategy is Unique:** No platform combines romance genre with strategic decision-making using a structured system (astrology). Dating sims exist but lack AI generation; AI platforms lack romance structure.

4. **Meta-Progression is Novel:** Cupid's own chart being revealed over multiple games creates unique replayability and self-reflection loop.

5. **Session Length Matters:** Brief, elegant sessions (20-30 min) target a different use case than endless sandboxes. Completable experiences have value.

6. **Character Engine Sophistication:** Spirit AI's approach (script + knowledge model) suggests how Mortal/Match could have deeper AI modeling.

7. **Hidden Door is Closest Competitor:** Both prioritize narrative arcs and literary quality. CUPID differentiates through romance focus, astrology mechanics, and session structure.
