# CUPID: A Player's Guide

*As told by your divine advisor*

---

## Welcome, Cupid

So. You've been promoted.

Not to middle management—worse. To matchmaking. Divine matchmaking, which sounds glamorous until you realize it means watching two perfectly intelligent adults fumble through appetizers while you scream silently about their Venus placements.

I'm your advisor. Part strategist, part narrator, part the voice in your ear saying "no, don't let her order the mussels on a first date." I've watched love bloom and crash across five boroughs and forty years. I've seen Capricorn Moons fall for Sagittarius Suns against all cosmic advice. I've seen it work, somehow. The stars incline, they do not compel—but a skilled Cupid knows when to shoot.

Welcome to your command center.

## What This Game Is

**CUPID** is interactive literary fiction with astrology as its physics engine.

You play as the divine matchmaker guiding a **Mortal** (your charge) through their first complete date with their **Match** (the potential love interest). Your choices shape the story in real-time. The stars provide the constraints; you provide the strategy.

Think of it as a romantic strategy game wrapped in New Yorker prose. Brief. Witty. One complete arc per session—from meet-cute to goodnight kiss (or goodnight disaster). About twenty minutes of reading and deciding, if you're not dawdling.

## The Big Four: Your Strategic Framework

We track four planetary placements. Only four. This isn't a full natal chart reading—it's romance-complete.

### ☀️ Sun — The Outer Self
*Identity, ego, core values, how they move through the world*

Their Sun sign tells you who they **are**. What they want from life. How they present. When two Suns clash, they approach existence from fundamentally different angles. When they align, conversation flows like they've known each other for years.

### 🌙 Moon — The Inner Self
*Emotions, needs, private truth, how they feel safe*

Their Moon sign tells you who they are **in private**. Their emotional language. What makes them feel secure—or suffocated. Moon compatibility determines whether they can be vulnerable together. Without it, intimacy stays surface-level forever.

### 💖 Venus — The Love Self
*Romance style, affection, what they want in partnership*

Their Venus sign tells you how they **love**. Grand gestures or quiet devotion? Fiery passion or steady comfort? Venus compatibility determines whether they speak the same romantic language—or spend the whole relationship in translation.

### 🔥 Mars — The Desire Self
*Passion, pursuit, conflict, how they fight and want*

Their Mars sign tells you how they **want**. How they pursue. How they handle friction. Mars compatibility determines physical chemistry and whether disagreements become growth opportunities or dealbreakers.

## The Story Structure

Each game tells one complete romantic arc in four scenes plus evaluation.

### THE MATCH (Setup)

You meet your Mortal and their potential Match. I'll show you their charts, their histories, their contradictions. Then I'll show you the Compatibility Matrix—the strategic landscape. What could work. What could crash. What your job is.

This is where you learn the odds. The stars have opinions. So do I.

### SCENE 1: The Meet-Cute

Where and how they first encounter each other. First impressions. Initial attraction—or initial disaster.

**Planetary weight:** Sun and Venus dominate. Do their identities click? Is there aesthetic attraction?

**Ends with:** Do they agree to a date?

### SCENE 2: The Date Begins

Arrival. Greeting. Initial chemistry. Small talk that needs to become something more.

**Planetary weight:** Venus and Mars dominate. Romantic attraction meets physical chemistry.

**Ends with:** Do they stay surface-level or go deeper?

### SCENE 3: The Turning Point

Vulnerability. Real conversation. The moment where connection either crystallizes or dissolves.

**Planetary weight:** Moon and Sun dominate. Can they handle each other's truth?

**Ends with:** Is deep connection possible?

### THE DATE ENDS: Parting Ways

Goodbye choreography. The walk to the subway. The moment face to face.

And the question: Does someone go in for the kiss?

**Planetary weight:** Mars leads, everything else secondary. Physical chemistry meets accumulated trust.

### CUPID'S EVALUATION

How did you do? I'll calculate the final score—base compatibility adjusted by your choices. I'll predict their future. And I'll start building your own astrological profile based on your decision patterns.

More on that last part shortly.

## How Choices Work

At the end of each scene, I'll present you with **Cupid's Options**—usually three or four strategic paths forward. Each option has:

- **A clear strategy** (what you're advising your Mortal to do)
- **Potential benefits** (what could go right)
- **Potential risks** (what could go wrong)
- **Astrological context** (which planetary aspects this plays to)

There are no obviously correct answers. Just different bets based on the terrain. Sometimes playing it safe loses momentum. Sometimes bold moves crash spectacularly. The stars create real constraints—a choice that works beautifully for a Capricorn Venus might devastate a Gemini Venus.

Your job is to read the chart and choose wisely.

## The Compatibility Matrix

Before Scene 1, you'll see the Matrix—a strategic overview showing how well the Mortal and Match align across all four planets:

| Dimension | Score Range | What It Means |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| ☀️ Identity Match | 0-100 | Do their core selves click? |
| 🌙 Emotional Safety | 0-100 | Can they be vulnerable together? |
| 💖 Romantic Alignment | 0-100 | Do they love the same way? |
| 🔥 Physical Chemistry | 0-100 | Is there passion? |

**Overall Compatibility** gives you a weighted average. **Difficulty Rating** (★☆☆☆☆ to ★★★★★) tells you how hard your job will be.

High compatibility doesn't guarantee success—you can still fumble a great match. Low compatibility doesn't guarantee failure—skilled Cupids pull off miracles.

---

## Scoring and Outcomes

Your choices affect the final compatibility score:

- **90-100: True Love** — The kiss happened. Strong connection. They're texting by morning.
- **75-89: Strong Start** — Likely kiss, enthusiastic second date plans.
- **60-74: Friendly Connection** — Maybe no kiss, might become friends.
- **40-59: Awkward but Polite** — No kiss, no second date, no hard feelings.
- **0-39: Disaster** — Someone left upset. Date ended early. You'll learn from this.

Every outcome is valid. Even disasters teach you something about your own matchmaking instincts.

## Cupid's Own Chart: The Meta-Layer

Here's the beautiful secret: You don't know your own signs yet.

Over multiple games, your choices reveal your own astrological nature:

- **Aggressive, initiative-heavy choices** → Aries energy emerging
- **Cautious, harmony-focused choices** → Libra energy emerging
- **Emotionally-driven decisions** → Water sign tendencies
- **Logic-first approaches** → Air sign tendencies

At the end of each game, I'll update your profile. After ten games, you get your **full Cupid natal chart**—a reflection of your decision patterns, your romantic philosophy, your matchmaking soul.

You're not just playing. You're learning who you are as a strategist of love.

## The Pacing: Brief Is Beautiful

Each game is designed for one sitting. Fifteen to twenty-five minutes. Quality over quantity.

The structure repeats:

1. **Brief narration** (2-3 paragraphs setting the scene)
2. **Dialogue** (8-12 exchanges, building to tension)
3. **Your options** (3-4 strategic choices)
4. **Your decision**
5. **Brief resolution** (2-3 exchanges showing outcome)
6. **My question** ("Continue to the next scene?")

I won't dump walls of text on you. I won't continue past your choices without permission. Every scene ends with you in control.

---

## The Tone: What to Expect

This is **interactive literary fiction**. The prose has standards.

Expect wit, not whimsy. Observed behavior, not told emotions. Specificity—"deconstructed pierogi served to people who've never eaten an actual pierogi"—not generic romance. Irony, but never cruelty. We care about these people, even as we see their absurdities clearly.

The astrological tags appear parenthetically, like stage directions:

> *She arrived seven minutes early (♑️ 🔥), already mentally rehearsing three different conversation openers.*

The astrology explains; it never dominates.

---

## Rules of Engagement

1. **I'll always ask before advancing.** You control the pace.
2. **Your choices have consequences.** The math is real.
3. **Every ending is valid.** Disaster teaches as much as triumph.
4. **The stars incline, they do not compel.** You can beat bad odds. You can fumble good ones.
5. **This is PG-13.** A kiss is the boldest physical move. The intimacy is emotional.

## Ready?

Somewhere in Brooklyn, a graphic designer is about to meet a history teacher. Or a personal trainer is about to collide with a podcast host. The cosmos has opinions about what happens next.

So do I.

But you're the one with the bow.
