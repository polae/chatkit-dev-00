We are working in `specs/cupid/` only.

I created a `design/` directory. Inside that, an `html/` directory.

Please use playwrightMCP to output the examples/cat-lounge/ app as a single .html file for Figma. as we do in specs/cupid-simple/design/

We will be using this as a starter layout template. Please preserve all content, components, layout and responsivity.
