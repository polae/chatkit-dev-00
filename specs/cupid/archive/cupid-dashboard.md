We are working in `specs/cupid/` only.

I created a `design/` directory. Inside that, an `html/` directory.

I would like to make a dashboard compeonent for the game cupid.

You can read the full instructions here: specs/cupid/instructions/cupid-simple-instructions.md

During the game I would like thte agent to doisplay the "fixed stats" from the game .(you can see the compatiiblity chart in the text output from the game.

but really I'd like the compatibility score to be the focus.

The compatibility is the rating given by the stars.

But we will have a new data point to track in a slider as in the design from cat-lougn here:specs/cupid/design/html/cat-lounge.html

So we would have two sliders (or an overlapping slider)

There is also a lot of infomration in specs/cupid/data/compatibility.yaml

I think bascially its

a display of the sun, moon, venus, and mars SCORES to who their compaitibility for each planet.

Then a connection score as a slider
a Combaitibilty score as a slider.

Druing her game,the ontly things that will change in the CONNECTION Score.

Please genrate three mockups in markdown, discuss and revise together. Then we'll move to make a template taht would fit in the bottm half of the cat-loung righ element (in the space of the three sliders in that design.
