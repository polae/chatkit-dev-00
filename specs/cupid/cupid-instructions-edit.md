Ok, we are making intrcutions for a story-game cupid. We are now working on

specs/cupid/instructions/

The instructions are sequenceed in OpenAI's Agent Builder like this:

'/var/folders/5w/q6swwyb531n0z5v4y5z9y2sr0000gn/T/TemporaryItems/NSIRD_screencaptureui_uRktb1/Screenshot 2025-12-03 at 6.47.05 AM.png'\

The instructions are triggers in this order (from the beginning through compatibility):

1. specs/cupid/instructions/cupid-agent-intro.md
2. specs/cupid/instructions/cupid-agent-mortal.md
3. specs/cupid/instructions/cupid-agent-match.md
4. specs/cupid/instructions/cupid-agent-compatibility.md

I find that we are in the app using the The Big Four, and that I'd like to rewrite:

specs/cupid/instructions/cupid-agent-compatibility.md -> specs/cupid/instructions/cupid-agent-compatibility-v2.md

Please do not overwrite the original. Make a new file.

In this file:

Remind us of the tone of the narrator in the instructions.

[Sun emoji] 1-2 sentences with the meaning of their signs, and its compatibility
[Moon emoji] 1-2 sentences with the meaning of their signs, and its compatibility
[Venus emoji] 1-2 sentences with the meaning of their signs, and its compatibility
[Mars emoji] 1-2 sentences with the meaning of their signs, and its compatibility

Verdict: 2-3 sentences about their prospects and potential liabilities.

I've found that the prior instructions was tooo much information. Here we're trying to give good brief data, some humorous analysis in our new yorker style.
