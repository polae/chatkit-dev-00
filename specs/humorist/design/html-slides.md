IN `specs/humorist/design/html/`

I want you to make an HTML template harness for slides. But the slides themselves shoudl simply be html. Full width, The harness is essentially a navbar with an iframe. This html page should simply display an html page inside a frame. But we want the humorist aestheic, and the nav bar at the top.

Ecah slide is it's own html file that simply displays full screen.

We shoudl keep exaclty the nav bar in the humorist style.
