You can see in `specs/humorist/design/html/apps/cupid` that we have many attempts at a compatibilty dashboard. \WE JUST WANT TO ISOLATE ANS SIMPLIFY the COMPATIBILTY SECTION.

Can you mock up a COMPATIBILITY WIDGET using HTML six variations on a comptibiilty widget.

Let's view it as activity rings, similar to this but in our aesthetic.

the rungs are: Sun moon venus mars base (compatibilty - the calculated
overall. Andd ht "currnet" just use (bas and current as labels). The currnt rign shoudl be the outside ring. The inner rings remain constant.

Make this as a slide in to add to '/Users/johnsteven/GITHUB/CHATKIT/chatkit-dev-00/specs/humorist/design/html/cupid-slides.html'\

Please jsut make six HTNL slides called compatibilty-widget and design a simple elegant ring chart ...

Use the aesthietic guide ...
