I'd like you to make slides in the humorist-style with the Cupid Player Guide:

`specs/cupid/docs/cupid-player-guide.md`

Please place all the new slides in a new dir:

`specs/humorist/design/html/slides`

Please link from the homepage.

And please place a new harness (a copy of `specs/humorist/design/html/slides_index.html`) in the same dir called `cupid-slides.html`

Please spin up subeagents to work on this in parallel one for each page.

This is the document:

`specs/cupid/docs/cupid-player-guide.md`

Please follow the humorist aestheitcs for layout and design. If you are impelled to use any imagery. please ONLY USE lucide icons. But feel free to do so.

Make this playful and elegant.
